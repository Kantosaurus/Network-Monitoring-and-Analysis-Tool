# 🦈 Wireshark: Full Capabilities and Toolsets

Wireshark is an open-source, industry-standard **network protocol analyzer** used by cybersecurity professionals, network engineers, and researchers for real-time packet inspection, troubleshooting, and analysis.

---

## 🧩 1. Packet Capture Capabilities

- **Real-time Capture**: Capture live network traffic from Ethernet, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, USB, or loopback interfaces.
- **Offline Analysis**: Load and analyze pre-captured `.pcap` or `.pcapng` files.
- **Promiscuous Mode**: Capture all packets visible to the network adapter, not just those addressed to your host.
- **Monitor Mode (Wi-Fi)**: Capture raw IEEE 802.11 frames including management and control packets.
- **Remote Capture**: Capture packets from remote interfaces using protocols such as SSH, RPCAP, or extcap.
- **Custom Capture Filters**: Define filters using libpcap syntax to capture only relevant traffic (e.g., TCP port 443).
- **Ring Buffers**: Automatically create new capture files when a specified size or time limit is reached.
- **Time-based Capture Control**: Stop or rotate captures based on duration or packet count.

## 🔍 2. Deep Packet Inspection and Analysis

- **Over 3,000 Supported Protocols**, including:
  - Layer 2: Ethernet, ARP, PPP, VLAN, 802.1Q
  - Layer 3: IPv4, IPv6, ICMP, OSPF, BGP
  - Layer 4: TCP, UDP, SCTP, DCCP
  - Application Layer: DNS, HTTP, HTTPS, TLS/SSL, SSH, SMTP, IMAP, POP3, FTP, DHCP, SNMP, SIP, RTP, MQTT, SMB, NFS, and many more.
- **Automatic Protocol Detection**: Identifies protocols even when using non-standard ports.
- **Decryption Support**:
  - TLS/SSL with provided session keys or private keys.
  - WPA/WPA2/WPA3 for Wi-Fi traffic (with capture of 4-way handshake).
  - IPsec, Kerberos, and other encryption protocols (when keys are available).
- **Stream Reassembly**: Reconstructs TCP and UDP streams for full-session analysis.
- **Packet Coloring Rules**: Highlights packets of interest based on filters and traffic type.
- **Follow Streams**: View full conversations (TCP, UDP, HTTP, TLS) in order.
- **Expert Information System**: Flags protocol anomalies, retransmissions, malformed packets, and performance issues.

## 🧠 3. Analysis Tools and Features

- **Display Filters**: Advanced filter engine using Wireshark’s custom syntax (e.g., `ip.src == 192.168.1.1 && tcp.port == 80`).
- **Statistics and Graphs**:
  - Protocol Hierarchy Statistics
  - Conversations (by IP, port, protocol)
  - Endpoints (host-level summaries)
  - IO Graphs (packet rate, throughput, latency over time)
  - TCP Stream Graphs (Round-trip time, sequence numbers, window scaling)
  - Flow Graphs (sequence of conversations)
  - Service Response Time (SRT) statistics
- **Name Resolution**: Resolve IPs to hostnames, MACs to vendors, ports to services.
- **Export Functions**: Export packets, streams, or statistical summaries to text, CSV, JSON, or XML.
- **Expert System Alerts**: Highlights retransmissions, malformed packets, and protocol violations.

## ⚙️ 4. Extensibility and Customization

- **Custom Plugins**:
  - Create dissectors in C, Lua, or Python.
  - Extend UI or automate workflows.
- **TShark CLI Tool**:
  - Command-line version of Wireshark for remote or automated analysis.
  - Supports filters, statistics, and export options identical to the GUI.
- **Extcap Interface**:
  - Integrate with third-party capture utilities (e.g., for USB, Bluetooth, or SDN environments).
- **Configuration Profiles**:
  - Save display filters, layouts, and color schemes per project.
- **Custom Columns**:
  - Add and arrange columns for any packet field dynamically.
- **Lua Scripting**:
  - Automate repetitive analysis or custom dissector logic.

## 📊 5. Visualization and Reporting

- **IO Graphs**: Time-based traffic visualization (packet rate, bytes per second, etc.).
- **TCP Stream Graphs**: Visualize congestion windows, round-trip times, and throughput.
- **Flow Graphs**: Sequence diagrams of communications between endpoints.
- **Packet Length and Timing Graphs**: Analyze jitter, delay, and packet size distribution.
- **Conversation Maps**: Visual summaries of network flows.
- **Export to CSV, JSON, XML, and PSML** for reporting and further analysis in external tools.
